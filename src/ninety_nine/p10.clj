;; P10 (*) Run-length encoding of a list.
;; Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called run-length
;; encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates of
;; elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the number of
;; duplicates of the element E.
;; 
;; Example:
;; * (encode '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
;; ((4 A) (1 B) (2 C) (2 A) (1 D)(4 E))
